#Let's put it all together now!

#Instructions
#We just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

#ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
#ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
#ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais
#Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

#Make sure to Google the current exchange rates for pesos, soles, and reais!
# Write code below ğŸ’–

p = (int(input("What do you have left in peses? ")))
s = (int(input("What do you have left in soles? ")))
r = (int(input("What do you have left in reais? ")))
d = p*0.00025 + s*0.28 + r*0.18
print(d)
